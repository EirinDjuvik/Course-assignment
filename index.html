    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">would advise them to include everyone in the security practices. Its also smart to adopt cybersecurity framework instead of using resources on building a new. This reduces costs and time. The client should also consider to automate and integrate their security tools since it makes less room for error. Further they should also follow secure software development practices- their  software developers must be educated about potential security problems like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site resource forgery (CSRF) and how to prevent them. 
        The best defense against XSS vulnerabilities is to remove or disable any markup that can potentially contain instructions to run the code.
        Sql injection attacks can be avoided by ensuring that any user data that is passed to an SQL query cannot change the nature of the query. 
        CSRF attacks can be preventes by having a server that require that post requests user-specific site-generated secret.
        They can avoid clickjacking by setting the appropriate HTTP headers
        DoS defenses usually work by identifying and blocking "bad" traffic while allowing legitimate messages through. 
        directory traversal, file inclusion and command injection can be prevented by sanitizing input before using it</p>
